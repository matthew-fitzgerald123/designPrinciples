# Task Manager Project
design principles project

The Task Manager project is a simple console-based application demonstrating the use of Singleton and Factory design patterns in Python.

**Process**
1. Created a TaskManager class that follows the Singleton design pattern ensuring a single instance to manage tasks.
2. Created a Task base class, and implemented two different task typesâ€”SimpleTask and TimedTask. Utilized the Factory pattern to create tasks dynamically at runtime.
3. Integrated and Managed Tasks: Integrated the TaskManager with TaskFactory to add, list, and manage tasks. This central management system allows tasks to be added dynamically and handled efficiently.
4. Tested and Verified the Functionality: Implemented a script to test the application by creating tasks, adding them to the manager, marking them as complete, and listing their statuses.

**Libraries Used:**
Time, ABC
